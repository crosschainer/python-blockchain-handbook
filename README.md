# Python Smart Contracts: Ecosystem Overview

A concise, Markdown-only overview of the major Python smart contract ecosystems.

## Overview

Smart contracts are self-executing programs on blockchain networks that enable decentralized applications and automated agreements without intermediaries.  
Pythonâ€™s clear syntax, extensive libraries, and data-science integrations make it a popular choice for writing, testing, and auditing smart contracts.

## Frameworks & Languages

### Vyper
A contract-oriented, Pythonic language targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), prioritizing security, simplicity, and auditability.

### PyTeal
A Python binding for writing Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1s) on the Algorand blockchain.

### SmartPy
A comprehensive framework for developing, testing, and deploying Tezos smart contracts using familiar Python syntax.

### Xian
A Layer-1 blockchain built natively for Python, embedding a Python VM within a CometBFT consensus engine for fast finality and built-in developer incentives.

## Getting Started

Install the core tools:

```bash
pip install vyper pyteal smartpy-cli xian-contracting
